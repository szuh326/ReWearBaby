**Sustainable Baby Wear Subscription — From Peru to Your Baby, With Love**

## 🌍 Why ReWearBaby?

Babies outgrow clothes in weeks, not years.  
Yet most baby clothes are worn only a handful of times before ending up in landfills.

ReWearBaby solves this by introducing a **circular baby wear system**:
- Parents subscribe instead of overbuying
- Clothes are reused, cleaned, and recirculated

## ✨ Key Features

- ♻️ **Circular Fashion Model**  
  Clothes are reused, swapped, and recycled — not wasted.


- 👕 **Flexible Subscription**  
  Swap sizes anytime as your baby grows.


- 💰 **Cost Effective**  
  Save 50–70% compared to buying new baby clothes.
